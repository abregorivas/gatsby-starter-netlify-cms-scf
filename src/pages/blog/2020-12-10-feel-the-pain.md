**Feeling the Pain**

Left on a sinking ship were the captain and three sailors. The captain spoke first. "Men, this business about a captain going down with his ship is nonsense. There's a three-man life raft on board and I'm going to be on it. To see who will come with me, I will ask you each one question. The one who can't answer will stay behind. Here's the first question: What unsinkable ship went down when it hit an iceberg?" The first sailor answered, "The Titanic, sir." "On to the next question: How many people perished?" The second sailor said, "One thousand five hundred and seventeen, sir." "Now for the third question," and the captain turned to sailor number three. "What were their names?"





**Felt a sense of despair.?**

**A sense of hopelessness?**

**Now that 3rd Sailor felt a true sense of helplessness**

**HOW’S YOUR WEEK?**

* Anybody feel like it’s been a challenging week.
* Maybe you’ve had a day or a week like “**Chippie**”

Chippie the parakeet never saw it coming. One second he was peacefully perched in his cage. The next he was sucked in, washed up, and blown over.

The problems began when Chippie's owner decided to clean Chippie's cage with a vacuum cleaner. She removed the attachment from the end of the hose and stuck it in the cage. The phone rang, and she turned to pick it up. She'd barely said "hello" when "ssssopp!" Chippie got sucked in.

The bird owner gasped, put down the phone, turned off the vacuum, and opened the bag. There was Chippie -- still alive, but stunned.

Since the bird was covered with dust and soot, she grabbed him and raced to the bathroom, turned on the faucet, and held Chippie under the running water. Then, realizing that Chippie was soaked and shivering, she did what any compassionate bird owner would do . . . she reached for the hair dryer and blasted the pet with hot air.

Poor Chippie never knew what hit him.

A few days after the trauma, the reporter who'd initially written about the event contacted Chippie's owner to see how the bird was recovering. "Well," she replied, "Chippie doesn't sing much anymore -- he just sits and stares."

\1. **Seriously** - You may think, "Nobody knows what I'm going through, nobody feels the pain I'm experiencing."

1) But God knows! 1) He knows your feelings and frustrations.\
1) He's sees the crisis in your soul.\
1) There's no hurt that goes unnoticed by God.\
1) Often when we're hurting, we feel very isolated and lonely.

* Maybe there's been a death of someone close to us – Norman Chavez (Serra High)
* a divorce or separation
* maybe we've lost a job or can’t find a job
* we start to think, "Nobody understands the way I feel;
* Nobody understands my pain."
* We learn to hide our pain
* Don’t want to be vulnerable
* Sometimes we just don’t want to talk about it.

Driving through Texas, a New Yorker collided with a truck carrying a horse. A few months later he tried to collect damages for his injuries. "How can you now claim to have all these injuries?" asked the insurance company's lawyer. "According to the police report, at the time you said you were not hurt." "Look," replied the New Yorker. "I was lying on the road in a lot of pain, and I heard someone say the horse had a broken leg. The next thing I know this Texas Ranger pulls out his gun and shoots the horse. Then he turns to me and asks, 'Are you okay?'"

* Hey, nobody is going to shoot you !
* Terrible misunderstanding of God
* Me as a young boy crying in the window when no one else was looking. Didn’t want to appear whimpish
* WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND JESUS BETTER
* **Hebrews 2:14-18**

*“Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil-- and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. For*

*this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.”*

1) Let’s just look at the last couple of days of Jesus’ life on this earth 1) We can see the hardships he had to endure 1) Jesus looking over Jerusalem just a couple of days before the Passover

**Matthew 23:37**

*"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."*

2) Jesus At The Last Supper – dealing with – Just hours before his death

**Luke 22:14-20**

“When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God." After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me." In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.”

1. Jesus declared his knowledge of the traitor in their midst: Judas (**Luke 22:21-23**)
2. Apostles arguing about who is the greatest (**Luke 22:24-30**)
3. Denial of Peter (Luke **22:31-34**)
4. Abandonment of friends at the cross
5. Forsaken by God, the Father

**Mark 15:34**

*“And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"-- which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"*

JESUS CAN RELATE – BIG TIME!!!

**FIRST OF ALL - GOD NOT ONLY SEES, HE CARES!***

**GOD HAS ALLOWED ME TO FEEL THIS PAIN – NOW HOW DO I DEAL WITH IT?**

**Step One: Validate Yourself**

**2 Thessalonians 2:13**

*“But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.”*

**Psalm 103:13-14**

*“As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him; for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.”*

1. He knows the causes, the reasons, the things that brought you to this point.

   1. He understands because he made you, and
   2. He sees the hurt in your heart like nobody else can.
2. We can give those feelings to God:

* **1 Peter 5:7**

*“Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.”*

* Cast them all permanently on God, once and for all, and then, don't take them back.
* Truly Jesus understands our pain. He has experienced it in so many ways and on so many levels.

**Step Two: Focus On Solutions, Not Problems**

* Pain is a part of life.
* Many people allow their pain to cripple them and keep them stuck, causing them to miss out on the next level that God was preparing them to go.
* A famous evangelist told the following incident: I have a friend who in a time of business recession lost his job, a sizable fortune, and his beautiful home. To add to his sorrow, his precious wife died; yet he tenaciously held to his faith -- the only thing he had left. One day when he was out walking in search of employment, he stopped to watch some men who were doing stonework on a large church. One of them was chiseling a triangular piece of rock. 'Where are you going to put that?' he asked. The workman said, 'Do you see that little opening up there near the spire? Well, I'm shaping this stone down here so that it will fit in up there.' Tears filled my friend's eyes as he walked away, for the Lord had spoken to him through that laborer whose words gave new meaning to his troubled situation.
* Don’t spend a lot of time thinking about your problems.\*\*
* I turned them over in my head again and again, focusing on what was wrong.\*\*
* It’s very easy to fall into this trap,\*\*
* all you do is worry about your problems and feel sorry for yourself\*\*
* **Philippians 3:13-15**

*“But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. All of us who are mature should take such a view of things.”*

**Step Three: Make Your Life About the Future, Not the Past**

* **Hebrews 12:2-3**

*“Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”*

**Step Four:** **Don’t Waste Your Pain**

* We all go through difficulties, setbacks and loss.
* **2 Corinthians 1:3-7**

*“Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort. “*

* Use the painful experiences in your life to help others gain perspective
* How to turn to God
* How God used your pain to teach you something very important (**Lessons Learned**)

**CONCLUSION**

1. WE HAVE A GREAT HEAVENLY FATHER “*who wants to gather us like a hen gathers her chicks*”
2. TURN YOUR PAIN OVER TO GOD.
3. JESUS IS THE GREAT PHYSICIAN WHO SAID:

**Mark 2:17**

*“On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."*

4. HE ALONE CAN HEAL YOU FROM **THE INSIDE OUT***
